# System Configuration

The System Configuration utility (MSConfig) is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 

The utility has five tabs across the top. Below are the names for each tab. We will briefly cover each tab in this task. 

* General
* Boot
* Services
* Startup
* Tools

In the General tab, we can select what devices and services for Windows to load upon boot. The options are: Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective. 

In the Boot tab, we can define various boot options for the Operating System. 

The Services tab lists all services configured for the system regardless of their state (running or stopped). A service is a special type of application that runs in the background.  

As you can see, Microsoft advises using Task Manager (taskmgr) to manage (enable/disable) startup items. The System Configuration utility is NOT a startup management program. 

# Change UAC Settings

The UAC settings can be changed or even turned off entirely (not recommended).

You can move the slider to see how the setting will change the UAC settings and Microsoft's stance on the setting.

# Computer Management

The Computer Management (compmgmt) utility has three primary sections: System Tools, Storage, and Services and Applications.
