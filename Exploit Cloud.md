### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS is a cloud solution in which you rent infrastructure. You purchase virtual power to execute your software as needed. This is much like running a virtual server on your own equipment, except that you run a virtual server on a virtual disk. IaaS is similar to a utility company model in that you pay for what you use.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides everything except applications. Services provided by this model include all phases of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and can use application programming interfaces (APIs), website portals, or gateway software. These solutions tend to be proprietary, which can cause problems if the customer moves away from the provider’s platform.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS is designed to provide a complete packaged solution. The software is rented out to the user. The service is usually provided through some type of front end or web portal. While the end user is free to use the service from anywhere, the company pays a per-use fee.


## Many attacks against cloud technologies are possible, and the following are just some of them:
* Credential harvesting
* Privilege escalation
* Account takeover
* Metadata service attacks
* Attacks against misconfigured cloud assets
* Resource exhaustion and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
* Cloud malware injection attacks
* Side-channel attacks
* Direct-to-origin attacks

## Credential Harvesting
Credential harvesting is not a new attack type, but the methodologies used by attackers have evolved throughout the years. Credential harvesting (or password harvesting) is the act of gathering and stealing valid usernames, passwords, tokens, PINs, and any other types of credentials through infrastructure breaches.
Many cloud services and cloud-hosted applications use single sign-on (SSO), and others use federated authentication. Sometimes cloud-based applications allow you to log in with your Google, Apple, or Facebook credentials. Attackers could redirect users to impersonated websites that may look like legitimate Google, Apple, Facebook, or Twitter login pages. From there, the attacker could steal the victim’s username and password.

## Privilege Escalation
Privilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug or design flaw in a software or firmware application to gain access to resources that normally would have been protected from an application or a user. This results in a user gaining additional privileges beyond what the application developer originally intended (for example, a regular user gaining administrative control or a particular user being able to read another user’s email without authorization).
The original developer does not intend for the attacker to gain higher levels of access but probably doesn’t enforce a need-to-know policy properly and/or hasn’t validated the code of the application appropriately. Attackers take advantage of this to gain access to protected areas of operating systems or to applications (for example, reading another user’s email without authorization). Buffer overflows are used on Windows computers to elevate privileges as well. To bypass digital rights management (DRM) on games and music, attackers use a method known as jailbreaking, which is another type of privilege escalation, most commonly found on Apple iOS-based mobile devices. Malware also attempts to exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities, if any exist on the system. Privilege escalation can also be attempted on network devices. Generally, the fix for this is simply to update the device and to check for updates on a regular basis.
### Vertical Privilege Escalation
This type of privilege escalation, also called privilege elevation, occurs when a lower-privileged user accesses functions reserved for higher-privileged users (for example, a standard user accessing functions of an administrator). To protect against this situation, you should update the network device firmware. In the case of an operating system, it should again be updated. The use of some type of access control system – for example, User Account Control (UAC)–is also advisable.
### Horizontal Privilege Escalation
This type of privilege escalation occurs when a normal user accesses functions or content reserved for other normal users (for example, one user reading another’s email). This can be done through hacking or by a person walking over to someone else’s computer and simply reading their email. Always have your users lock their computer (or log off) when they are not physically at their desk.
## Account Takeover
The underlying mechanics and the attacker motive of a cloud account takeover attack are the same as for an account takeover that takes place on premises. In an account takeover, the threat actor gains access to a user or application account and uses it to then gain access to more accounts and information. There are different ways that an account takeover can happen in the cloud. The impact that an account takeover has in the cloud can also be a bit different from the impact of an on-premises attack. Some of the biggest differences are the organization’s ability to detect a cloud account takeover, find out what was impacted, and determine how to remediate and recover.
There are a number of ways to detect account takeover attacks. Select each for more detail.
* Login location
* Failed login attempts
* Lateral phishing emails
* Malicious OAuth, SAML, or OpenID Connect connections
* Abnormal file sharing and downloading
## Metadata Service Attacks
Traditionally, software developers used hard-coded credentials to access different services, such as databases and shared files on an FTP server. To reduce the exposure of such insecure practices, cloud providers (such as Amazon Web Services [AWS]) have implemented metadata services. When an application requires access to specific assets, it can query the metadata service to get a set of temporary access credentials. This temporary set of credentials can then be used to access services such as AWS Simple Cloud Storage (S3) buckets and other resources. In addition, these metadata services are used to store the user data supplied when launching a new virtual machine (VM) – such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or AWS EC2 instance – and configure the application during instantiation.
As you can probably already guess, metadata services are some of the most attractive services on AWS for an attacker to access. If you are able to access these resources, at the very least, you will get a set of valid AWS credentials to interface with the API. Software developers often include sensitive information in user startup scripts. These user startup scripts can be accessed through a metadata service and allow AWS EC2 instances (or similar services with other cloud providers) to be launched with certain configurations. Sometimes startup scripts even contain usernames and passwords used to access various services.
## Attacks Against Misconfigured Cloud Assets
Attackers can leverage misconfigured cloud assets in a number of ways. Select each for more information.
* Identity and Access Management (IAM) Implementations
* Federation Misconfigurations
* Object Storage
* Containerization Technologies
## Resource Exhaustion and DoS Attacks

Attackers can launch more strategic DoS attacks against applications hosted in the cloud that could lead to resource exhaustion. For example, they can leverage a single-packet DoS vulnerability in network equipment used in cloud environments, or they can leverage tools to generate crafted packets to cause an application to crash. For instance, you can search in Exploit Database (exploit-db.com) for exploits that can be used to leverage “denial of service” vulnerabilities, where an attacker could just send a few packets and crash an application or the whole operating system
Another example of a DoS attack that can affect cloud environments is the direct-to-origin (D2O) attack. In a D2O attack, threat actors are able to reveal the origin network or IP address behind a content delivery network (CDN) or large proxy placed in front of web services in a cloud provider. A D2O attack could allow attackers to bypass different anti-DDoS mitigations.
## Cloud Malware Injection Attacks
Cloud deployments are susceptible to malware injection attacks. In a cloud malware injection attack, the attacker creates a malicious application and injects it into a SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS environment. Once the malware injection is completed, the malware is executed as one of the valid instances running in the cloud infrastructure. Subsequently, the attacker can leverage this foothold to launch additional attacks, such as covert channels, backdoors, eavesdropping, data manipulation, and data theft.
## Side-Channel Attacks
Side-channel attacks are often based on information gained from the implementation of the underlying computer system (or cloud environment) instead of a specific weakness in the implemented technology or algorithm. For instance, different elements – such as computing timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, and even sound – can provide detailed information that can help an attacker compromise a system. The attacker aims to gather information from or influence an application or a system by measuring or exploiting indirect effects of the system or its hardware. Most side-channel attacks are used to exfiltrate credentials, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information by measuring coincidental hardware emissions.
